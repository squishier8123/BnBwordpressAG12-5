## Why This Folder Exists

During the project, several approaches were attempted and refined. The "revised" versions in `02_IMPLEMENTATION/` represent the current, tested approach. We kept these older versions to:

1. **Preserve project history** - See how the approach evolved
2. **Document learnings** - Understand what was tried and why it changed
3. **Provide context** - Reference for future troubleshooting

## How to Use This Folder

✅ **Do:**

- Research for how problems were originally diagnosed
- Documentation of the iterative development process

❌ **Don't:**
