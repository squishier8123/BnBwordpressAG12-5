## DESIGN PRINCIPLES

### Visual Hierarchy
- Use heading sizes to guide attention
- Most important info at top
- Use whitespace to separate sections
- One primary CTA per section (not multiple)

### Mobile Responsiveness

- CTA buttons should be large (touch-friendly)
- Text should be readable without zooming
- Test at 320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px widths

### Color & Brand
- Limit to 3-4 colors (your brand palette)
- Use contrast for important CTAs
- Consistent throughout

### Copy Principles
- Benefit-focused (not feature-focused)
- Short sentences (under 15 words)
- Scannable (bullet points, not paragraphs)
- Action-oriented (verbs, not nouns)

### Visual Content
- High-quality photography (golden hour hunting images)
- Icons for features and benefits
- Authentic user photos (testimonials)
- Avoid stock photos that look generic

### CTA Button Strategy
- Primary CTAs: Contrasting color, stands out
- One primary CTA per section
