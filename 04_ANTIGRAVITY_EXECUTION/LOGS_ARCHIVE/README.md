## Why This Archive Exists

During active project development, many status summaries were created to track progress. These have been archived to:

1. **Preserve project history** - See how the project evolved
2. **Reduce clutter** - Keep active execution folder focused
3. **Maintain reference** - Available if questions arise about previous phases

- `/04_ANTIGRAVITY_EXECUTION/README.md` - Current execution guide
- `/02_IMPLEMENTATION/` - Current implementation documents
- `/docs/` - Current documentation
